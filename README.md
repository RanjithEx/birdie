Birdie is a small game based out of HTML and JavaScript where the player controls a bird flying through obstacles to achieve a high score. The game is simple, addictive, and easy to play.

The sole purpose of this game is to illustrate HTML DOM manipulations.

## Notes
This game was inspired by Flappy Bird, a popular game that was released in 2013. 

## Limitations
- The game may run at different speeds in different browsers. This is because the time parameter is not being considered for updating the game elements.
- Scaling issues prevent it from running on mobile devices. So disabled it for the time being.
- Performance: The game does not make use of high performance WebGL interfaces, instead it uses the default rendering only.
